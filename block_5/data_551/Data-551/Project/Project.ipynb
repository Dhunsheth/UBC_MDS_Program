    "# Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "DATA 551 is a project-based course where you will be working in a team of 3-4 students with the goal of designing a dashboard for interactive data visualization, exploration, and communication. We expect that this project will take up a vast majority of your time dedicated to this course. In addition to principles of effective dashboard development, this project will allow you to practice concept design, prototyping and presenting your work, as well as creating a final product for a target user.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create a scenario for your dashboard, which includes choosing the target audience (internal research team, public communication, etc), who you are (part of a company, NGO, research team, student group, etc), and the goal of building the app for your target audience (communicating your research to the public, deriving market insight, driving end user decision making, etc). It is fine if your plans change slightly as you are building the app, but try to stick to it as much as possible so that you have a clear direction throughout, or update your plan/scenario as needed. As a team you will agree on how to work during this project and formalize it by writing a teamwork contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will ask anyone out side of your group to test your dashboard. You will then get and incorporate feedback into one final round of improvements to finalize your dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will be spread out over four milestones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 1 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In milestone 1, you will do following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In your group, select a dataset of your choice for your interactive dashboard. Consider the EDA steps (described below) when selecting the dataset for your interactive dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create/develop a scenario where your dashboard will answer a big question for a particular audience, or solve a problem. Basically, your task is to come up with a compelling purpose for your dashboard to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write the teamwork contract and establish expectations and norms of working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sketch a vision for your dashboard (on paper or a drawing app); you may choose to have two sketches, one for a realistic, achievable dashboard and another as a “stretch goal”, something you can do if everything goes according to plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements for the EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has eight steps: Describe your dataset, Load the dataset, Explore your dataset, Initial thoughts, Wrangling, Research Questions (RQ), Data analysis & visualizations, Summary and conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Must include all eight steps of the EDA (Describe your dataset, Load the dataset, Explore your dataset, Initial thoughts, Wrangling, Research Questions, Data analysis & visualizations, Summary and conclusions)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must include at least 3 visualizations, and no more than 6\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each visualization must adhere to the principles of effective visualizations (you should have seen these in DATA 550).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comments on your EDA must be authentic and genuine, ideally in full sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a dataset for your project with the following criteria **and get it approved by the course TA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Permission to use and distribute**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Look for a creative commons license (CC4 for e.g.) or Public Domain and check to make sure you can make it publicly available\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do not use datasets that require authentication, or APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to choose datasets that have no more than 5-10% missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure there are at least 2500 rows/observations in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure there are at least 5 variables of potential interest in the dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interesting (to you)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure you have some basic interest in the subject matter!\n",
    "\n",
    "* There’s nothing worse than doing a project on the penguins or mtcars dataset (please don’t pick those)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are literally thousands of datasets available, I will point you to some high quality sources (keep in mind that I have not personally checked every single dataset):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [fivethirtyeight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [pudding.cool](https://github.com/the-pudding/data)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT: I strongly suggest you spend a bit of effort choosing a good dataset and interesting research questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 2 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In milestone 2, you will create and deploy a prototype dashboard in Python, using Altair and Dash.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 3 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In milestone 3, you will test your dashboard. For this step, find another group in the class (so you will swap your dashboards for testing). Ask the evaluators questions with the goal of improving your dashboard in the next milestone. You can refer to **user interaction questions** or **visual design questions** in [this](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/user-experience-survey-questions) link. For this step, have a clear goal of what you are looking for from the user experience testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Milestone 4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain and justify your choice for selecting different visualizations and designing your dashboard.\n",
    "Then create a final version of your dashboard incorporating any feedback you have received from user testing.\n"
