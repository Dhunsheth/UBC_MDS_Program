I created a repo in GitHub and here is the link:
https://github.com/khalad-hasan/data541

git clone https://github.com/khalad-hasan/data541
cd data541
touch master.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Added master.txt"

[Now if I go to the directory where I cloned the remote repo, I will see master.txt file and .git directory]

To create a new branch:
git branch newBranch
To checkout to the branch:
git checkout newBranch

[Now I am at the new branch, where I can see the same and folder  - master.txt and git direcroty]

To create a new file in the newBranch:

touch branch.txt

[Now I can see two files, branch.txt and master.txt. I am going to commit the changes.]

git add .
git commit -m "added branch.txt"

Now to navigate to the main branch
git checkout main 

[I am at the main branch. Interestingly, I can only see one text file there - master.txt where I created another file, branch.txt in the newBranch. If I go to the new branch with "checkout" command, I will see two files as I had committed there before. ]

To merge the file:

 git merge newBranch

[Now I can see two files in the directory. The branch.txt file is merged from the other branch]
