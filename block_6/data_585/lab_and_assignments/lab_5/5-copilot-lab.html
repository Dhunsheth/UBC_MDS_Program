<p>The objective of this lab is to familiarize yourself with copilot. Consider the associate file 5-copilot.md, which records Q/A with copilot to create code to solve lab 4 on SVM using 3 different codes (SVM, optimization, and ANN). Create several python files (SVM.py, SVM-opt.py, and SVM-ANN.py) containing copies of the copilot-generated code. Verify that those files run correctly (ask copilot to fix them if you encounter any error; they ran fine on my computer as long as I installed the relevant packages).

<p>Create a similar copilot conversation to solve assignment 4-LASSO.html. The goal is get more experience asking copilot (aka prompt engineering) in preparation for assignment 5.
