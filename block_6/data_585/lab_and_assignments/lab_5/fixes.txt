Fixes needed to make the code work:

1. Copilot code referenced packages that I did not have installed and required me to install them, such as 'skopt' -> needed to run 'pip install scikit-optimize'.

2. Error when using BayesSearchCV, currently when using BayesSearchCV and MLPClassifier, cannot specify all hidden_layer_sizes, however the co-pilot did not account for this and specified it the same was as for all the other cases which was causing an error. 

To make the code work the fix was specifying the search space as follows:

search_spaces = {
    'hidden_layer_sizes': [50,100],
    'activation': Categorical(['tanh', 'relu']),
    'solver': Categorical(['sgd', 'adam']),
    'learning_rate_init': Real(0.001, 0.1, prior='log-uniform')
}

* This fix was not found from the co-pilot but from stackoverflow instead. (source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63308474/error-when-trying-to-tune-mlpclassifier-hidden-layer-sizes-using-bayessearchcv)

3. tpot package needed to be installed. 'tpot' -> 'pip install tpot'.
