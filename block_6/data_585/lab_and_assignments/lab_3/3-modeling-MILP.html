<p>You are free to use any optimization platform you prefer. Suggested ones are: R, Python, MATLAB/YALMIP, Julia. Ask for TA for more information on any of those; and definitely ask permission from your TA if you wish to use another platform (so your work can be graded).

<ol type="I">
	<li>Solve using software the following LP $\max_{x_1,x_2} 2x_1+3 x_2$ subject to $2x_1+x_2\leq 10$, $x_1+x_2\leq 6$, $-x_1+x_2\leq 4$, and $x_2\geq 0$.
    <li> We plan a meal at Milky King. The choices are: (name, price, calories , sodium [mg] , sugar [g])
        <ul>
            <li>Snowblast Mini $2.89, 360, 180, 43;
            <li>Snowblast Large $4.69, 1020, 540, 118;
            <li>French Fries regular $2.19, 380, 790, 0;
            <li>French Fries large $2.69, 490, 1030, 0;
            <li>Side salad $2.19, 25, 15, 3;
            <li>Cheese burger $2.19, 380, 930, 8.
        </ul>
        Design a meal subject to the constraints:
        <ul>
            <li>calories between 500 and 800,
            <li>sodium less than 1200,
            <li>sugar less than 40 grams.
        </ul>
        Make it as cheap as possible. Do not impose integer constraints
    <li>Solve the same problem but now imppose integer constraints.
    <li>We saw in class the 4 types of possibilities for LP problems. Implement the examples for Possibilities 2,3,4 to see how your solver deals with it. Note: You might encounter weird outcomes. This question will make you aware of such outcomes.
