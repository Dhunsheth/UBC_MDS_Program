The objective of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with solvers, classification of optimization problems, and what algorithm to choose. To complete the assignment, you can and are expected to use online resources. Most of your time is likely to be spent learning about your selected optimization platform.

<p>You are free to use any optimization platform you prefer. Suggested ones are: R, Python, MATLAB/YALMIP, Julia. Ask for TA for more information on any of those; and definitely ask permission from your TA if you wish to use another platform (so your work can be graded).

<ol type="I">
	<li>Using <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/problems-handled-by-optimization-toolbox-functions.html">Choosing a solver</a> indicate what function should be called and what algorithm is expected to perform best for each of the following optimization problems.
		<ol>
		<li>The Rosenkbrock's banana function: 
		\[\inf_{x_1, x_2} 100 (x_2-x_1^2)^2+(1-x_1)^2\]
		Note you can view several of these algorithms in action by running MATLAB, clicking help, search: banana, select Optimization Toolbox Examples then in the Nonlinear programming section, select Minimization of the Banana Function.
		<li>The optimization problem
		\[\inf_{x,y} \{x y : x\geq 0, y\geq 0, x+y\leq 1 \}\]
		<li>The optimization problem
		\[\inf_{x,y} \{x y : 5 x^2 + 20 y^2\leq 3\}\]
		</ol>
    You may look at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/problems-handled-by-optimization-toolbox-functions.html">Problems Handled by Optimization Toolbox Functions</a> for examples of function to call. 
    
	<li>Create a graph plot with contours, and a contour plot for the optimization problem $\inf_{x,y} \{x y : 5 x^2 + 20 y^2\leq 3\}$ (examples of such plots can be found at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/optimization-toolbox-tutorial.html">Tutorial for the Optimization Toolbox</a>. Then use your favorite solver to compute a minimum.
</ol>

<p>Submit
<ul>
<li>A written answer (typed or scanned) for questions I, and II above;
<li>The MATLAB generated pictures for the last question;
<li>The MATLAB code to compute the minimum for Question II.
</ul>
