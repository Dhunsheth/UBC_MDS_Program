    "\n",
    "#### This lab will be graded based on the following rubrics:\n",
    "   - **1) Code** : \n",
    "      - Accuracy: The code runs perfectly and the output is clear without being unnecessarily verbose.  \n",
    "      - Quality: Code readability is exceptional and code functionality is unambiguous. For example:\n",
    "         * Variable names are clear and self-documenting, an appropriate amount of whitespace is used to maximize visibility, tabs and spaces are not mixed for indentation, sufficient comments are given.\n",
    "         * All functions have proper documentation (docstrings in Python). \n",
    "         * Overall, code organization and documentation is impeccable. \n",
    "         * Code repetition is minimized via the use of loops/mapping functions, functions or classes or scripts/files as needed without becoming overly complicated. \n",
    "         * Functions are short, concise, and cohesive without losing clarity; code can be easily modified. \n",
    "         * Tests are present to ensure functions work as expected. Exceptions are caught and thrown if necessary.\n",
    "      - Efficiency: Code is as fast as it can reasonably be given the specifications of the problem.\n",
    "  - **2) Use a systematic strategy to solve the exercises:**\n",
    "      1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.\n",
    "      2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.\n",
    "      3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. \n",
    "      4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs.            "

    "## Recursion - Towers of Hanoi - 1 Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. He was inspired by a legend that tells of a Hindu temple where the puzzle was presented to young priests. At the beginning of time, the priests were given three poles and a stack of 64 gold disks, each disk a little smaller than the one beneath it. Their assignment was to transfer all 64 disks from one of the three poles to another, with two important constraints. They could only move one disk at a time, and they could never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The priests worked very efficiently, day and night, moving one disk every second. When they finished their work, the legend said, the temple would crumble into dust and the world would vanish.\n",
