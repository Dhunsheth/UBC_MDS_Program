    "### A note for this lab\n",
    "#### This lab will be graded based on the following rubrics:\n",
    "   - **1) Code** : \n",
    "      - Accuracy: The code runs perfectly and the output is clear without being unnecessarily verbose.  \n",
    "      - Quality: Code readability is exceptional and code functionality is unambiguous. For example:\n",
    "         * Variable names are clear and self-documenting, an appropriate amount of whitespace is used to maximize visibility, tabs and spaces are not mixed for indentation, sufficient comments are given.\n",
    "         * All functions have proper documentation (docstrings in Python). \n",
    "         * Overall, code organization and documentation is impeccable. \n",
    "         * Code repetition is minimized via the use of loops/mapping functions, functions or classes or scripts/files as needed without becoming overly complicated. \n",
    "         * Functions are short, concise, and cohesive without losing clarity; code can be easily modified. \n",
    "         * Tests are present to ensure functions work as expected. Exceptions are caught and thrown if necessary.\n",
    "      - Efficiency: Code is as fast as it can reasonably be given the specifications of the problem.\n",
    "   - **2) Reasoning**: Mastery of the learning material is demonstrated, original ideas may be presented.  In the case of short-answer questions, the correct method was used and the correct result attained. Analysis is thorough and exhaustive without being drawn out or lacking focus. Thesis is clear and the arguments that support it are flawless and very well-reasoned, leaving no obvious gaps, and are communicated clearly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Exercise 1 - searching in arrays (2.5 marks)\n",
    "1. Write a Python function `search_unsorted` that takes in an unsorted list/array and a value, and searches to see if that value is in the array. You should use a loop to do this. (0.5 mark) \n",
    "2. Write a Python function `search_sorted` that takes in an _sorted_ list/array and a value, and searches to see if that value is in the array. Use binary search for this. (1 mark) \n",
    "3. What is the time complexity of these two operations? Answer in big-O notatio and explain your answer. You can use LaTeX directly within Markdown here, to write equations. For example, $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ is written as `$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$`. (0.5 mark)\n",
    "4. Test your answer above empirically. Some further info: (0.5 mark)\n",
    "   * Generate the array with random integers between 0 and $10^7$ using `numpy.random.randint` \n",
    "   * check to see if the number 999 is in the array\n",
    "   * To sort the array, use `array.sort()`\n",
    "   * To time a line of code, you can use `timeit`. An example is given below.\n",
    "   * Use array sizes $10^2$, $10^3$, $10^4$, $10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7$\n",
    "   * Present your results in a Markdown table. A skeleton of the table is given below\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Python already has syntax for checking whether an array contains a particular value. The syntax is `key in data`. Empirically measure the speed of this method and compare it with your two functions. Try to explain your observations."
